# CS-CodeSamples
The "ViewControllers" folder contains all the code for the various scenes of the water app for First Lego League. The app was called Leak Detector. 
The "Python" folder has all my Science Research files, programmed in Python to conduct data analysis and machine learning, in some cases, on various datasets. The chess and diabetes data was just practice for making ML models and visualizing the data; the Conclusions.py and ADEfor2016analysis were directly pertaining to the main phase of the project.
